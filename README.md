# Stacked Generator

This package acts as a generator for the [stacked](https://pub.dev/packages/stacked) v1.9.0 and onwards. It aims at generating the routing and the dependencies by defining them on the new `StackedApp` annotation.  To read more about the usage of the generated code take a look at the [application setup](https://pub.dev/packages/stacked#application-setup) section of the stacked readme.
